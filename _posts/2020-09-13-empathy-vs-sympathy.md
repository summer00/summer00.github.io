Feeling bad with someone is not the same as empathy. Empathy is the ability of understand the emotions of someone else without feeling the emotions. Sympathy is the physical display of empathy. You hug them, you try to put your feet in their shoes. Psychopaths have empathy but they don't have sympathy. Altruism is detached and emotionless, based on doing what is right.

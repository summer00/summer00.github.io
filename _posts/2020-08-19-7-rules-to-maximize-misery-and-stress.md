formula: stress = unsatisfied desire _ T = want/have _ T

There are two way to increase stress:

- Want more than you have.
- Increase the time(T) it takes to get what you want.

7 Rules:

1. Desire to be there, not here
   1. There is where but not here.
   2. There is that place where you have more.
   3. It's that the magic destination that you're always running towards.
   4. Once you desire to be there, it's very important that you never arrive.
2. Never learn from your mistakes, or better yet, repeat them
3. Be ungrateful
   1. Remove the word enough from your vocabulary and replace it with more.
   2. Refuse to enjoy simple pleasures like a sunny day, a nice meal, or a good joke, because that might convince you it's okay to be right here, right now.
   3. Trave from destination to destination, never stopping to smell the roses along the way.
4. Be arrogant
5. Ruminate endlessly
6. Don't live sustainably
7. Keep people who follow the other principles around you

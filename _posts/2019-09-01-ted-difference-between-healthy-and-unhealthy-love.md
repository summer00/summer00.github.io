# Three main goals

We have three main goals: 
* give all of us a language for talking about a subject that's quite awkward and uncomfortable to discuss;
* empower a whole front line, namely friends, to help;
* improve all of our ability to love better

# signs of unhealthy love

## intensity

* Abusive relationships don't start out abusive. They start out exciting and exhilarating.
* In unhealthy love, these feelings shift over time from exciting to overwhelming and maybe a little bit suffocating.
* It's important to remember that it's not how a relationship starts that matters, it's how it evolves.
* It's important in the early days of a new relationship to pay attention to how you're feeling.
* It's also really important to start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs.

## isolation

* solation creeps in when your new boyfriend or girlfriend starts pulling you away from your friends and family, your support system, and tethering you more tightly to them.
* solation is about sowing seeds of doubt about everyone from your prerelationship life.
* Healthy love includes independence, two people who love spending time together but who stay connected to the people and activities they cared about before.

# Living in Production

Software design as taught today is terribly incomplete. It only talks about what systems should do. It doesn't address the converse - what systems should not do.

Most software is designed for the development lab or the testers in the QA
department. Testing - even agile, pragmatic, automated testing - is not enough to prove that software is ready for the real world.

## The Scope of the Challenge

1. large active user counts
2. Uptime demands have increased
3. to build software fast that's cheap to build, good for users, and cheap to operate
